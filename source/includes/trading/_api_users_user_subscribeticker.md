The response returns an array of objects , each object an unlabeled, comma-delimited array of numbers. The Open price and Close price are those at the beginning of the tick â€” the Interval time subscribed to in the request. For 24-hour exchanges, the trading day runs from UTC midnight to UTC midnight; highs, lows, opens, closes, and volumes consider that midnight-to-midnight period to be the trading day. The data order is:

- date/time UTC in milliseconds since 1/1/1970
- high
- low
- open
- close
- volume
- inside bid price
- inside ask price
- instrument ID
